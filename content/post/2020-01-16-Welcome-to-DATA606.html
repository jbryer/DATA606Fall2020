<p>Welcome to DATA606! My name is Dr. Jason Bryer and I will be your instructor for this semester. In addition to teaching this course, I am Principal Investigator of a Department of Education grant to develop a Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (see <a href="https://www.DAACS.net">www.DAACS.net</a> for more information) and a Research Data Associate at Cornell University. Couple of important notes as you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>The course syllabus located here: <a href="https://fall2020.data606.net" class="uri">https://fall2020.data606.net</a> I will post all course materials there. Blackboard will be used primarily for submitting assignments.</li>

This will be our primary mode of communication.

<li>Introduce yourself in the Getting Acquainted forum on Blackboard.</li>
<li>Once you go through the syllabus, try starting Lab 1 as soon as you can. This will require you to install R and RStudio and will help get you get acquainted with R.</li>
