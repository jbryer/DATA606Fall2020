The solutions to the practice problems are at the end of the book and do not need to be handed in. Graded assignments should use the provided R markdown templates provided below. Data for the homework assignments, and for within the chapters too, can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2020/tree/master/course_data/os3_data). Or alternatively all the data is included in the `openintro` R packge (use the `data(package = 'openintro')` command to list all the datasets available in that package). Right click on the "Template" link and choose "Save link as..." to save the R markdown file to your computer. By default, the Rmarkdown files should generate PDFs. This is the preferred format since PDFs can be uploaded to Blackboard. See the [software](/course-overview/software/) course page for instructions on installing LaTeX.
