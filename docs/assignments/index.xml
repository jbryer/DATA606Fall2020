      <description>The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) is a formative assessment designed to provide you with information about key college skills. DAACS includes assessments in self-regulated learning, mathematics, reading, and writing. YOU ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE SELF-REGULATED LEARNING ASSESSMENT. This should take about 10 minutes to complete the assessment and there is no passing or failing. Once you are done, I encourage you to review the resources recommended to you.</description>
